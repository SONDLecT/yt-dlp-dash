```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:5000"  # Access on port 8080
```

### Custom Download Directory

Mount any directory as the download location:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/your/downloads:/downloads
```

### Custom yt-dlp Options

Use the "Custom Flags" JSON field to pass any yt-dlp option:

```json
{
  "writeinfojson": true,
  "writethumbnail": true,
  "embedthumbnail": true,
  "embedsubtitles": true,
  "format": "bestvideo[height<=1080]+bestaudio/best"
}
```

## File Management

Downloaded files appear in the "Downloaded Files" section:
- View file name and size
- Click "Download" to retrieve files from the server
- Files are stored in the mounted volume

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Downloader**: yt-dlp (latest version)
- **Media Processing**: ffmpeg
- **Container**: Python 3.11 slim base image

## Updating

To update yt-dlp to the latest version:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### Downloads fail with "format not available"
- Try selecting "Best Quality" or a different quality preset
- Some videos may not have all quality options available

### Audio extraction fails
- Ensure ffmpeg is installed in the container (it should be by default)
- Check container logs: `docker logs ytdlp-web`

### Can't access the web interface
- Ensure the port isn't already in use
- Check firewall settings
- Verify container is running: `docker ps`
